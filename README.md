# Optocus

Authors: Liliia Parashchak and Kyrylo Pervushyn

## Overview

Optocus is an educational and informative application developed by Kyrylo Pervushyn and Liliia Parashchak as a project for the course at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. It is designed to work with lenses and learn optics, helping users solve optical problems, simplify the calculation of lens optical powers, gamify the construction of optical systems, and enhance their knowledge of optical devices. The application targets students studying optics as part of their physics curriculum, as well as anyone interested in understanding optical phenomena.

## Functional Features

- Lens Constructor: Implement a lens constructor that allows users to build and calculate optical characteristics of systems composed of converging and diverging lenses, parabolic mirrors, and diaphragms.
- Lens Selection: Provide the ability to choose different types of lenses.
- Ray Drawing and Point Placement: Enable users to draw rays and place points on the optical system.
- Input Parameters: Allow users to input parameters for lenses.
- Parameter Calculations and Image Construction: Perform calculations of parameters and construct images based on the input data.
- Additional Objects: Implement the addition of additional objects such as parabolic mirrors and diaphragms.

## Optics Device Guide

The application includes a comprehensive guide that describes the operation of typical optical devices, including telescopes, binoculars, magnifying glasses, and cameras. The guide provides general information, descriptions, and instructions on creating these devices.

## Phenomena Encyclopedia

The application also features an encyclopedia of optical phenomena, which provides descriptions and explanations of various optical phenomena.

## System Description

- Programming Language: C++
- GUI Library: Qt
- Graphics Library: OpenGL
- Development Environment: CLion
- Build System: CMake
- Version Control: Git
- Repository: GitHub (cloud-based)

## Documentation

The application should be accompanied by a user manual that explains the core functionality, purpose of buttons and tools, and provides guidance on using the application effectively.

## System Requirements

The Optocus application is designed to be cross-platform, but manual compilation on target device is required (project comes with CMakeLists.txt files to be compiled using CMake). The presence of Qt libraries and OpenGL is also required.
